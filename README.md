# Spectrum-Challenge

Project for Advanced Network Topics Course. This is an implementation for the annual Spectrum Challenge of University of Thessaly.
A USRP-based radio design, with GNU-Radio software, that could best use a communication channel in the presence of other dynamic users and interfering signals. The challenge took place on the NITOS infrastructure. 

GNU Radio was used as baseline.

The implementation consists of:

-a bi-directional communication Î¿n the reciever and the transmiter node.
-transmitter to receiver for the basic transmition of the packets.
-receiver to transmiter for the feedback channel.
-compression on the packets.
